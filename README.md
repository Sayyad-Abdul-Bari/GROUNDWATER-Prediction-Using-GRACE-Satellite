# GROUNDWATER Prediction Using GRACE Satellite
This project focuses on predicting ground water levels using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. The data includes detailed measurements of Earth's gravity field, which provides insights into Earth's water reservoirs over land, ice, and oceans. The project uses machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate ground water levels based on various environmental factors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We conducted an exploratory data analysis on the GRACE data and found that the variation in ground water thickness is more significant in latitude than longitude. This suggests that the water level remains relatively constant with longitude. We also discovered that the thickness does not vary much longitudinally, and most of the thickness is generated by variations in latitude.

## Machine Learning Model
We used Grid Search CV to fine-tune the best parameters for our machine learning model. We also used the Elastic Net, which includes L1 and L2 regularizers to prevent overfitting. Our model achieved an R2 value of 94.88%, indicating that it can predict regression values with a high degree of accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the use of machine learning techniques to predict ground water levels based on GRACE satellite data. The project's findings suggest that latitude has a more significant impact on ground water thickness than longitude. The model achieved a high degree of accuracy, making it a promising tool for predicting ground water levels in the future.
